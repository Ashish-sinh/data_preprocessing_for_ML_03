Get ready to enhance your data analysis and machine learning skills with these powerful techniques and tools related to learning curves and feature selection! 🌟

## File 1: learning_curve.ipynb 📈
- Learning Curve Analysis 📈: Understand the performance of your machine learning models as you vary the size of the training dataset.
- Learning Curve Visualization 📊: Plot learning curves to identify overfitting, underfitting, and the optimal model complexity.

## File 2: feature_selection.ipynb 🎯
Feature Selection Techniques 🎯:
- Correlation-based Feature Selection 🎯: Identify relevant features based on their correlation with the target variable.
- Mutual Information 📊: Measure the dependency between features and the target, capturing both linear and non-linear relationships.
- Chi-Square Test 📊: Perform chi-square statistical test to select features in categorical target scenarios.
- Variance Threshold 📏: Remove low-variance features that do not significantly contribute to the target.
- Mutual Information for Regression 📈: Utilize mutual information for regression tasks to select informative features.
- Feature Importance Ranking 🏆: Rank features based on their importance in predictive models, such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.

# File 3: outlier_detection.ipynb 🔍
- Box Plot 📊: Visualize and identify outliers in your data using box plots.
- Z-Score for Outlier Detection 📈: Use Z-Score to quantify the deviation of data points from the mean and identify outliers.

These resources will empower you to preprocess your data efficiently, enhance model performance, and accelerate your data-driven decision-making process 🎓🔍
